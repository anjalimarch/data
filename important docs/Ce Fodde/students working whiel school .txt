In Bygones days concept of working with and after school was not appreaciated much, However Nowadys mostly in developed nations 
Students are working with and after school. 

In my opinion Working with school and after school is a best chice as it makes students a better and more resopinsible invidual. 


Firstly, Students learn time management, They have to come work at time and there will not any further procastination, They learn hoe to manage 
time to complete their day to da task. 

Secondly,Time management, Another trait which makes students more responsible is learning wealth management they get to know how How to spend hard earned 
money due dilligently and use it for wealth cretaion and finding out investment options. It makes individua more responsible and confident. 


Thirdly, Socialising with people and building network, While working with school students get and idea of how to make and earn friendships which may help 
them in future life. 


In addition to that students learn how to workin team and achive goals while working as a team.
More Over team building is key to complete any job before time where we can use individuals as per their strengths, Students can learn that trait while working 
with school. 


Other than that they get to know how make right career choices at early days of the career, for example individual can choose to work part time in hospital 
if he or she wants to gain the real time expirience of the sector and later can decide whether to choose as a career option or not. 

To sum up, I would conclude, Working while school makes students and better and more responsible individual. They get the confidence of face any challenge in life going further 
As they have idea money and time management and bettter understanding of people at work.
