Endangered Species 


Nowadays due to various environmental effects and increase in construction activities nearby residentials places, various species of birds are falling in to endangered category.
I think every citigen of the country is responsible for that and its an individual's responsiblity to be aware of the facts that huge civilization and leaving the place for animals 
and birds will affect the environment badly.
In my opinion despite civilaization is important to grow and to earn the living, we should be equally concious about the adverse effects of that on environment and animals.

Please find below reasons why I agree that endangered species are due to excessive civilization -


1- First, construction and over construction in the forest area plays a major role, which is making birds and animal homeless, we should encourage the forestation rather deforestationn.


2-Second, Rehabitilization, Endangered species like birds should be and can be rehabitilated, and as Citizen we should also encourage that for example we can plant small space in our house or 
flat or in balcony area so that Birds can live there.


3- Third, Balancing the deforesttaion, If we are cuting the trees due to overdemand of contruction and civilization we should plant new trees and there shold be some legitimate action on the
same if no one plants atleast two saplings while cutting one tree.

4- Fouth, Deforestation should not be permiitable if animal mass is more there It should not be like, as Human we are making poor animals homeless.


To sum up, I conclude that encouraging over deforestation and construction is leading us towards the destruction of nature, because of that animala are loosing their space, chances of survival.
