Kids are being raised in country side and as well as city side. Both have its respective pros and cons 
Nowadays Mojority wants to grow and move towards better anities and quality and easy life. 


In my opinion being raised city side is more benvolent than country side 

First of all, Cities have better education and Job oppurtinity. 

second, Beter Civilization, Quality of life and Various aminiteis like medical health care, schools, universities, colleges, 
Play grounds and areas. 


Third, City has various options to explore for student and figure out the ideas for the better life. 


Fourth, While being student can explore various job oppuritinities as well. 

Five, In country side, getting better various options for schooling, subjects choice is tediuos.
As it is a liited world with very limted oppotunities. 

Apart from education and Quality life, cities are known for better social life. 

To sum up, i woul conclude that cities are best place for being raised and living a bettter life than country side.
As country side is having limited living option like farming , Dairy.
